## Introduction

CredSweeper is a tool to detect credentials in any directories or files.
CredSweeper could help users to detect unwanted exposure of credentials
(such as personal information, token, passwords, api keys etc.) in advance.
By scanning lines, filtering, and using AI model as option,
CredSweeper reports lines with possible credentials, where the line is,
and expected type of the credential as a result.

Full documentation can be found here: <https://credsweeper.readthedocs.io/>

## How To Use

### Main Requirements

- Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11

### Installation

Details [here](https://credsweeper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

```bash
pip install credsweeper
```

### Run

[How to use](https://credsweeper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html).

Get all argument list:

``` bash
python -m credsweeper --help
```

Run CredSweeper:

``` bash
python -m credsweeper --path tests/samples/password.gradle --save-json output.json
```

To check JSON file run:

```bash
cat output.json
```

``` json
[
    {
        "api_validation": "NOT_AVAILABLE",
        "ml_validation": "VALIDATED_KEY",
        "ml_probability": 0.99755,
        "rule": "Password",
        "severity": "medium",
        "line_data_list": [
            {
                "line": "password = \"cackle!\"",
                "line_num": 1,
                "path": "tests/samples/password.gradle",
                "info": "",
                "value": "cackle!",
                "value_start": 12,
                "value_end": 19,
                "variable": "password",
                "entropy_validation": {
                    "iterator": "BASE64_CHARS",
                    "entropy": 2.120589933192232,
                    "valid": false
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

### Config

[credsweeper/secret/config.json](credsweeper/secret/config.json) - Configuration file for pre-processing of CredSweeper. For more details please check [here](https://credsweeper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overall_architecture.html#pre-processing).

You can set the `pattern`, `extension` and `path` you want to exclude from scanning as below.

``` json
{
    "exclude": {
        "pattern": [
            "AKIA[0-9A-Z]{9}EXAMPLE",
            ...
        ],
        "extension": [
            "gif",
            "jpg",
            ...
        ],
        "path": [
            "/.git/",
            "/openssl/",
            ...
        ]
    },
    ...
}
```

And you can also set `source_ext`, `source_quote_ext`, `find_by_ext_list`, `check_for_literals`, `line_data_output`, and `candidate_output` as below.

- `source_ext`: List of extensions for scanning categorized as source files.
- `source_quote_ext`: List of extensions for scanning categorized as source files that using quote.
- `find_by_ext_list`: List of extensions to detect only extensions.
- `check_for_literals`: Bool value for whether to check line has string literal declaration or not.
- `line_data_output`: List of attributes of [line_data](credsweeper/credentials/line_data.py) for output.
- `candidate_output`: List of attributes of [candidate](credsweeper/credentials/candidate.py) for output.

``` json
{
    ...
    "source_ext": [
        ".py",
        ".cpp",
        ...
    ],
    "source_quote_ext": [
        ".py",
        ".cpp",
        ...
    ],
    "find_by_ext_list": [
        ".pem",
        ".cer",
        ...
    ],
    "check_for_literals": true,
    "line_data_output": [
        "line",
        "line_num",
        ...
    ],
    "candidate_output": [
        "rule",
        "severity",
        ...
    ]
}
```

[credsweeper/rules/config.yaml](credsweeper/secret/config.yaml) - Configuration file for setting Rule. For more details please check [here](https://credsweeper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overall_architecture.html#rule).

``` yaml
...
- name: API
severity: medium
type: keyword
values:
- api
filter_type: GeneralKeyword
use_ml: true
validations: []
- name: AWS Client ID
...
```

## Develop

### Tests

To run all tests:

``` bash
python -m pytest --cov=credsweeper --cov-report=term-missing -s tests/
```

To run only tests independent of external api:

``` bash
python -m pytest -m "not api_validation_test" tests/
```

To obtain manageable (without subprocesses) coverage:

``` bash
python -m pytest --cov=credsweeper --cov-report=html tests/ --ignore=tests/test_app.py
```

### Benchmark

We have a dataset for testing credential scanners that called [CredData](https://github.com/Samsung/CredData). If you want to test CredSweeper with this dataset please check [here](https://github.com/Samsung/CredData/blob/main/README.md#benchmark).

## Overall Architecture

To check overall architecture of CredSweeper please check [here](https://credsweeper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overall_architecture.html).

## Retrain Model

If you want to check how model was trained or retrain it on your own data, please refer to the [experiment](experiment/README.md) folder
