## Introduction

CredSweeper is a tool to detect credentials in any directories or files. CredSweeper could help users to detect unwanted exposure of credentials  (such as personal information, token, passwords, api keys and etc) in advance. By scanning lines, filtering, and using AI model as option, CredSweeper reports lines with possible credentials, where the line is, and expected type of the credential as a result.

Full documentation can be found here: <https://credsweeper.readthedocs.io/>

## How To Use

### Main Requirements

* Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9

### Installation

Details [here](https://credsweeper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

[How to use](https://credsweeper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html).

Get all argument list:

``` bash
python -m credsweeper --help
```

Run CredSweeper:

``` bash
python -m credsweeper --path tests/samples/password --save-json output.json
```

To check JSON file run:

```bash
cat output.json
```

``` json
[
    {
        "rule": "Password",
        "severity": "medium",
        "line_data_list": [
            {
                "line": "password = \"cackle!\"",
                "line_num": 1,
                "path": "tests/samples/password",
                "entropy_validation": false
            }
        ],
        "api_validation": "NOT_AVAILABLE",
        "ml_validation": "VALIDATED_KEY"
    }
]
```

### Tests

To run all tests:

``` bash
python -m pytest --cov=credsweeper --cov-report=term-missing -s tests/
```

To run only tests independent from external api:

``` bash
python -m pytest -m "not api_validation" --cov=credsweeper --cov-report=term-missing -s tests/
```

### Benchmark

We have a dataset for testing credential scanners that called [CredData](https://github.com/Samsung/CredData). If you want to test CredSweeper with this dataset please check [here](https://github.com/Samsung/CredData/blob/main/README.md#benchmark).

## Overall Architecture

To check overall architecture of CredSweeper please check [here](https://credsweeper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overall_architecture.html).

## Retrain Model

If you want to check how model was trained or retrain it on your own data, please refer to the [experiment](experiment/README.md) folder
