## Introduction

CredSweeper is a tool to detect credentials in any directories or files. CredSweeper could help users to detect unwanted exposure of credentials  (such as personal information, token, passwords, api keys and etc) in advance. By scanning lines, filtering, and using AI model as option, CredSweeper reports lines with possible credentials, where the line is, and expected type of the credential as a result.

## How To Use
### Main Requirements

- Python3.7 or higher

### Installation
#### Via pip

Without Ml validation feature
```bash
pip install credsweeper
```

With Ml validation feature
```bash
pip install credsweeper[ml]
```

#### Via git clone (dev install)

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Samsung/CredSweeper.git
cd CredSweeper
# Annotate "numpy", "scikit-learn", and "tensorflow" if you don't want to use the ML validation feature.
pip install -qr requirements.txt 
```

### Run

Get all argument list:
``` bash
$ python -m credsweeper --help

usage: python -m credsweeper [-h] (--path PATH [PATH ...] | --diff_path PATH [PATH ...]) [--rules [PATH]] [--ml_validation] [-b POSITIVE_INT] [--api_validation] [-j POSITIVE_INT] [--skip_ignored] [--save-json [PATH]] [-l LOG_LEVEL]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --path PATH [PATH ...]
                        file or directory to scan
  --diff_path PATH [PATH ...]
                        git diff file to scan
  --rules [PATH]        path of rule config file (default: credsweeper/rules/config.yaml)
  --ml_validation       ml validation option on
  -b POSITIVE_INT, --ml_batch_size POSITIVE_INT
                        batch size for model inference (default: 16)
  --api_validation      api validation option on
  -j POSITIVE_INT, --jobs POSITIVE_INT
                        number of parallel processes to use (default: number of CPU cores * 2)
  --skip_ignored        parse .gitignore files and skip credentials from ignored objects
  --save-json [PATH]    save result to json file (default: output.json)
  -l LOG_LEVEL, --log LOG_LEVEL
                        provide logging level. Example --log debug, (default: 'warning'), 
                          detailed log config: credsweeper/secret/log.yaml 
```

Get output as JSON file:
``` bash
$ python -m credsweeper --ml_validation --path tests/samples/password --save-json output.json
rule: Password / severity: medium / line_data_list: [line : 'password = "cackle!"' / line_num : 1 / path : tests/samples/password / entropy_validation: False] / api_validation: NOT_AVAILABLE / ml_validation: VALIDATED_KEY
$ cat output.json
[
    {
        "rule": "Password",
        "severity": "medium",
        "line_data_list": [
            {
                "line": "password = \"cackle!\"",
                "line_num": 1,
                "path": "tests/samples/password",
                "entropy_validation": false
            }
        ],
        "api_validation": "NOT_AVAILABLE",
        "ml_validation": "VALIDATED_KEY"
    }
]
```

Get CLI output only:
``` bash
$ python -m credsweeper --ml_validation --path tests/samples/password
rule: Password / severity: medium / line_data_list: [line : 'password = "cackle!"' / line_num : 1 / path : tests/samples/password / entropy_validation: False] / api_validation: NOT_AVAILABLE / ml_validation: VALIDATED_KEY
```

### Tests

To run all tests:
``` bash
$ python -m pytest --cov=credsweeper --cov-report=term-missing -s tests/
```

To run only tests independent from external api:
``` bash
$ python -m pytest -m "not api_validation" --cov=credsweeper --cov-report=term-missing -s tests/
```

### Benchmark

We have a dataset for testing credential scanners that called [CredData](https://github.com/Samsung/CredData). If you want to test CredSweeper with this dataset please check [here](https://github.com/Samsung/CredData/blob/main/README.md#benchmark).
