Overall Architecture
====================

CredSweeper is largely composed of 3 parts as follows. (Pre-processing_, Scan_, `ML validation`_)

Pre-processing
--------------

When paths to scan are entered, get the files in that paths and the files are excluded based on the list created by `config.json <apps_config.html>`_.

**config.json**

- exclude
   - pattern: Regex patterns to exclude scan.
   - extension: Extensions to exclude scan.
   - path: Paths to exclude scan.
- source_ext: List of extensions for scanning categorized as source files.
- source_quote_ext: List of extensions for scanning categorized as source files that using quote.
- find_by_ext_list: List of extensions to detect only extensions.
- check_for_literals: Bool value for whether to check line has string literal declaration or not.
- line_data_output: List of attributes of `line_data <credentials.html#module-credsweeper.credentials.line_data>`_ for output.
- candidate_output: List of attributes of `candidate <credentials.html#module-credsweeper.credentials.candidate>`_ for output.

.. code-block:: text

    ...
    "exclude": {
        "pattern": [
            ...
        ],
        "extension": [
            ".7z",
            ".JPG",
            ...

        ],
        "path": [
            "/.git/",
            "/.idea/",
            ...
        ]
    }
    ...

Scan
----


Basically, scanning is performed for each file path, and it is performed based on the Rule_. Scanning method differs from scan type of the Rule_, which is assigned when the Rule_ is generated. There are 3 scan types: `SinglePattern <scanner.scan_type.html#module-credsweeper.scanner.scan_type.single_pattern>`_, `MultiPattern <scanner.scan_type.html#module-credsweeper.scanner.scan_type.multi_pattern>`_, and `PEMKeyPattern <scanner.scan_type.html#module-credsweeper.scanner.scan_type.pem_key_pattern>`_. Below is the description of the each scan type and its scanning method.

- `SinglePattern <scanner.scan_type.html#module-credsweeper.scanner.scan_type.single_pattern>`_
   - When : The Rule_ has only 1 pattern.
   - How : Check if a single line Rule pattern present in the line.
- `MultiPattern <scanner.scan_type.html#module-credsweeper.scanner.scan_type.multi_pattern>`_
   - When : The Rule_ has 2 patterns.
   - How : Check if a line is a part of a multi-line credential and the remaining part exists within 10 lines below.
- `PEMKeyPattern <scanner.scan_type.html#module-credsweeper.scanner.scan_type.pem_key_pattern>`_
   - When : The Rule_ type is `pem_key`.
   - How : Check if a lineâ€™s entropy is high enough and the line have no substring with 5 same consecutive characters. (like 'AAAAA')

Rule
----

Each Rule_ is dedicated to detect a specific type of credential, imported from `config.yaml <rules_config.html>`_ at the runtime.

**config.yaml**

.. code-block:: yaml

    ...
    - name: API
    severity: medium
    type: keyword
    values:
    - api
    filter_type: GeneralKeyword
    use_ml: true
    validations: []
    - name: AWS Client ID
    ...

**Rule Attributes** 

- severity
   - `Severity <common.html#credsweeper.common.constants.Severity>`_

    .. code-block:: python

        ...
        class Severity(Enum):
            CRITICAL = "critical"
            HIGH = "high"
            MEDIUM = "medium"
            LOW = "low"
        ...

- type
   - `RuleType <common.html#credsweeper.common.constants.RuleType>`_
    
    .. code-block:: python

        ...
        class RuleType(Enum):
            KEYWORD = "keyword"
            PATTERN = "pattern"
            PEM_KEY = "pem_key"
        ...

- values
   - keyword : The keywords you want to detect. If you want to detect multiple keywords, you can write them as follows : `password|passwd|pwd`.
   - pattern : The patterns you want to detect. For more accurate detection, it is recommended to specify `?P<value>` in the patterns : `(?P<value>AIza[0-9A-Za-z\-_]{35})`.
- filter_type
   - The type of the Filter_ group you want to apply. Filter_ groups implemented are as follows: `GeneralKeyword <filters.group.html#module-credsweeper.filters.group.general_keyword>`_, `GeneralPattern <filters.group.html#module-credsweeper.filters.group.general_pattern>`_, `PasswordKeyword <filters.group.html#module-credsweeper.filters.group.password_keyword>`_, and `UrlCredentials <filters.group.html#module-credsweeper.filters.group.url_credentials_group>`_.
- use_ml
   - The attribute to set whether to perform ML validation. If true, ML validation will be performed.
- validations
   - The type of the validation you want to apply. Validations implemented are as follows: `GithubTokenValidation <validations.html#module-credsweeper.validations.github_token_validation>`_, `GoogleApiKeyValidation <validations.html#module-credsweeper.validations.google_api_key_validation>`_, `GoogleMultiValidation <validations.html#module-credsweeper.validations.google_multi_validation>`_, `MailchimpKeyValidation <validations.html#module-credsweeper.validations.mailchimp_key_validation>`_, `SlackTokenValidation <validations.html#module-credsweeper.validations.slack_token_validation>`_, `SquareAccessTokenValidation <validations.html#module-credsweeper.validations.square_access_token_validation>`_, `SquareClientIdValidation <validations.html#module-credsweeper.validations.square_client_id_validation>`_, and `StripeApiKeyValidation <validations.html#module-credsweeper.validations.stripe_api_key_validation>`_.

Filter
------

Check the detected candidates from the formal step. If a candidate is caught by the Filter_, it is removed from the candidates set.
There are 21 filters and 4 filter groups. Filter_ group is a set of Filter_s, which is designed to use many Filter_s effectively at the same time.

ML validation
-------------

CredSweeper provides pre-trained ML models to filter false credential lines.
`ML validation` is on by the default and its  sensitivity can be adjusted using ``--ml_threshold``:

.. code-block:: text

     --ml_threshold FLOAT_OR_STR
        setup threshold for the ml model.
        The lower the threshold - the more credentials will be reported.
        Allowed values: float between 0 and 1, or any of ['lowest', 'low', 'medium', 'high', 'highest']
        (default: medium)

And ML can be fully disable by setting ``--ml_threshold 0``

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m credsweeper --ml_threshold 0 ...

Our ML model architecture is a combination of Bidirectional LSTM with additional handcrafted features.
It uses last 50 characters from the potential credential and 91 handcrafted features to decide if it's a real credential or not.

Example:

.. code-block:: text

    leaked_cred.py:
    my_db_password = "NUU423cds"

Steps:

1. Regular expression extracts ```NUU423cds``` as a secret value, ```my_db_password``` as a variable, and ```my_db_password = "NUU423cds"``` as whole line
2. Handcrafted feature classes instantiated from classes in `features.py <https://github.com/Samsung/CredSweeper/blob/main/credsweeper/ml_model/features.py>`_ using `model_config.json <https://github.com/Samsung/CredSweeper/blob/6a2e575987448dd20895a8e72efb3b09fdcbecc2/credsweeper/ml_model/model_config.json#L10>`_. Instantiation process can be checked at `ml_validator.py#L46 <https://github.com/Samsung/CredSweeper/blob/main/credsweeper/ml_model/ml_validator.py#L46>`_. Features include: ``` ``` character in line: yes/no, ```(``` character in line: yes/no, file extension is ```.c```: yes/no, etc.
3. Handcrafted features from step 2 used on line, value, variable, and filename to get feature vector of length 91
4. ```NUU423cds``` lowercased and right padded with special padding characters to the length 50. Last 50 characters selected if longer. Only 70 symbols used: 68 ASCII characters + 1 padding character + 1 special character for all other symbols: `ml_validator.py#L29 <https://github.com/Samsung/CredSweeper/blob/6a2e575987448dd20895a8e72efb3b09fdcbecc2/credsweeper/ml_model/ml_validator.py#L29>`_. Padded line than `one-hot encoded <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot>`_. Link to corresponding code: `ml_validator.py#L63 <https://github.com/Samsung/CredSweeper/blob/6a2e575987448dd20895a8e72efb3b09fdcbecc2/credsweeper/ml_model/ml_validator.py#L63>`_
5. Padded line from step 4 inputted to Bidirectional LSTM. LSTM produce single vector of length 60 as output
6. LSTM output and handcrafted features concatenated into a single vector of length 151
7. Vector from step 6 feed into the two last Dense layers
8. Last layer outputs float value in range 0-1 with estimated probability of line being a real credential
9. Predicted probability compared to the threshold (see `--ml_threshold` CLI option) and credential reported if predicted probability is greater
